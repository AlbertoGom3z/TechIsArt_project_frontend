The MVP is to produce an alternate view to existing art across collections by searching across centuries, culture, technique and classification. Technology is art  (tech is art) takes a look at art's silent partner 'technology' and shows searches about technique and medium. As tech has advanced it has influenced how artists create and showcase their work.

Worked with the Harvard Art Museums API and have planned to explore art across other collections and different museums. We hope to foster more interest in viewing, participating and experiencing the arts (across all forms) from new and existing audience.

This project contains html, css, javascript and jquery. Users were given the capability to CRUD as they interacted with the images. This site is an educational site by Alberto Gomez and is a work in progress. Please see credit lines for accreditation to the respective institutions.
